# Collection of Advent of Code attempts

Each year can be run by typing `python3 -m year_{YEAR}` in your console when inside the year directory.

For example to run the year 2019 run `python3 -m year_2019`.

The script will prompt you to enter the day you would like to run.

## Running tests

Every day should provide a `test.py` file that can be run by running `python3 -m unittest day_02.test`
